## How to Use This Wiki

This wiki is designed to be a helpful resource for power systems engineers, researchers, and students.
Here are some tips on how to make the most of it:

1. **Navigating the Wiki**: Use the table of contents or search function to quickly find the terminology or topic you're interested in.
1. **Understanding Entries**: Each term is defined based on excerpts from reliable sources such as papers, standards, and reports. Please note that these definitions are linguistic in nature.
1. **Contributing**: If you notice any errors or omissions, or if you have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on the repository.

## Why This Wiki Exists

Language is inherently ambiguous, and power system terminologies are no exception. Inspired by an email titled “Definitions of Smart Grids a Decade Ago – What Has Changed?” on Power-Globe in 2024, I decided to compile terminologies from papers, standards, reports, and other traceable sources to build this wiki.

## Disclaimer

When consulting this wiki, please keep the following in mind:

- **Not a primary reference:** Most items are excerpted from various sources.
- **Not comprehensive:** Some important terminologies may be missing.
- **Not authoritative:** The terminologies are not rigorously proven mathematical theories.
- **Not up-to-date:** Terminologies are subject to interpretation and may change over time.

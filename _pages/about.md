## Introduction

This open-access wiki is designed to help power system professionals, researchers, and students quickly find clear, concise definitions of key terms and acronyms in the industry.
Whenever a concept has multiple interpretations—whether in academic papers, technical standards, or industry reports—our goal is to present relevant definitions side by side, with citations to the original sources.
Here are some tips on how to make the most of it:

## How to Use

1. **Browse or search**: Navigate via the wiki or use the search bar to locate terms instantly.
1. **Compare definitions**: Some entries include excerpts from multiple sources—standards, peer-reviewed papers, and industry guidelines—so you can see how usage varies.
1. **Stay current**: Terminology evolves as the field advances. We update entries regularly; check back for the latest additions and revisions.
1. **Contribute**: Spot an error, omission, or new term? Please open an issue or submit a pull request on our GitHub repository.

## Why This Wiki Exists

Language is inherently ambiguous, and power system terminologies are no exception. Inspired by an email titled “Definitions of Smart Grids a Decade Ago – What Has Changed?” on Power-Globe in 2024, I decided to compile terminologies from papers, standards, reports, and other traceable sources to build this wiki.

## Disclaimer

- **Not a primary source:** We quote and cite definitions from existing standards, papers, and reports.
- **Not exhaustive:** Some important terminologies may be missing.
- **Not rigorous:** The terminologies are not rigorously proven mathematical theories.
- **Subject to change:** As power systems evolve, definitions may be updated.

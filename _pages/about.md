## Disclaimer

What you should keep in mind when consulting this wiki:

- NOT a primary reference. Most of the items are **EXCERPTED** from the sources.
- NOT comprehensive. Some important terminologies can be missing.
- NOT authoritative. The terminologies are not mathematical theories that have been rigorously proved.
- NOT up-to-date. The terminologies are often subject to interpretation and change over time.

## Wiki-wide Acronyms

## Motivation

Language itself is inherently ambiguous, and the terminologies in power systems are no exception.
Inspired by a talk titled "Definitions of Smart Grids a Decade Ago â€“ What Has Changed?" that began
on Power-Globe in 2024, I decided to excerpt terminologies from papers, standards, reports, and
other traceable sources to build a wiki.

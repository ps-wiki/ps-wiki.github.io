## How to Use This Wiki

This wiki serves as a resource for power systems engineers, researchers, and students, providing quick access to and clear explanations of terminologies in the power systems field, particularly when multiple definitions or interpretations exist.
Here are some tips on how to make the most of it:

1. **Navigating the Wiki**: Use the table of wiki or search function to quickly find the terminology or topic you're interested in.
1. **Understanding Entries**: Each term is defined based on excerpts from sources such as papers, standards, and reports. Please note that these definitions are linguistic in nature.
1. **Staying Updated**: Terminologies in the power systems field can evolve. Check back periodically for updates and new entries.
1. **Contributing**: If you notice any errors or omissions, or if you have suggestions for improvement, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request on the repository.

## Why This Wiki Exists

Language is inherently ambiguous, and power system terminologies are no exception. Inspired by an email titled “Definitions of Smart Grids a Decade Ago – What Has Changed?” on Power-Globe in 2024, I decided to compile terminologies from papers, standards, reports, and other traceable sources to build this wiki.

## Disclaimer

When consulting this wiki, please keep the following in mind:

- **Not a primary reference:** Most items are excerpted from various sources.
- **Not comprehensive:** Some important terminologies may be missing.
- **Not authoritative:** The terminologies are not rigorously proven mathematical theories.
- **Not up-to-date:** Terminologies are subject to interpretation and may change over time.

## Introduction

This open-access wiki is designed to help power system professionals, researchers, and students quickly find clear, concise definitions of key terms and acronyms in the industry.
Whenever a concept has multiple interpretations—whether in academic papers, technical standards, or industry reports—our goal is to present relevant definitions side by side, with citations to the original sources.

## How to Use

1. **Browse or search**: Navigate via the wiki or use the search bar to locate terms instantly.
1. **Compare definitions**: Some entries include excerpts from multiple sources—standards, peer-reviewed papers, and industry guidelines—so you can see how usage varies.
1. **Stay current**: Terminology evolves as the field advances. We update entries regularly; check back for the latest additions and revisions.
1. **Contribute**: Spot an error, omission, or new term? Please open an issue or submit a pull request on our GitHub repository.

## Why This Wiki Exists

Language is inherently ambiguous, and power system terminologies are no exception. Inspired by an email titled “Definitions of Smart Grids a Decade Ago – What Has Changed?” on Power-Globe in 2024, I decided to compile terminologies from papers, standards, reports, and other traceable sources to build this wiki.

## Disclaimer

- **Not a primary source:** We quote and cite definitions from existing standards, papers, and reports.
- **Not exhaustive:** Some important terminologies may be missing.
- **Not rigorous:** The terminologies are not rigorously proven mathematical theories.
- **Subject to change:** As power systems evolve, definitions may be updated.

To achieve this, a planning case Distribution Factor (DFAX) report is run by PJM Transmission Planning and reviewed by MMD for each unit. This analysis and review covers all equipment with a 3% DFAX on external facilities for a transfer of power from the requested Pseudo-Tie unit into PJM. Any equipment with a 3% or greater DFAX, for normally impacted facilities, and 3-5% for N-1 outage impacted facilities will be updated and/or modeled in the PJM EMS. This is to match the Native Balancing Authority’s model, unless otherwise determined necessary, to properly dispatch the unit.\n\n> DFAX: Distribution Factors\n"

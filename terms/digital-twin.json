A change made to the physical object automatically leads to a change in the digital object and vice versa.

The digital representation holds information from multiple sources across the product life cycle. This information is continuously updated and is visualised in a variety of ways to predict current and future conditions, in both design and operational environments, to enhance decision making.”\n> - Madni 2019 [10] \"A Digital Twin is a virtual instance of a physical system (twin) that is continually updated with the latter’s performance, maintenance, and health status data throughout the physical system’s life cycle.”\n\n[5] E.

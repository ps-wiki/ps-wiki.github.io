The PJM Reserve Markets are conducted in both the Day-ahead Market and Real-time Market processes. In the Day-ahead Market, PJM schedules Reserves on a simultaneously, co-optimized basis with Energy for each hour of the next Operating Day.</p> <p>In Real-time, PJM procures Reserves on a simultaneously, co-optimized basis with Energy for each hour and each interval. Both the Day-ahead and Real-time Reserve Markets are offer-based and procure resources to meet the required Reserve Services:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Synchronized Reserve Service</strong>: can only be satisfied by online resources that are able to respond in ten (10) minutes or less.</li> <li> <strong>Primary Reserve Service</strong>: can be satisfied by online or offline resources that are able to respond in ten (10) minutes or less.</li> <li> <strong>30-Minute Reserve Service</strong>: can be satisfied by online or offline resources that are able to respond in thirty (30) minutes or less.</li> </ul> <p>PJM has three reserve products that can meet the required Reserve Services:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Synchronized Reserve Product</strong>: online resources that are able to respond in ten (10) minutes or less. The Synchronized Reserve product can satisfy the Synchronized Reserve, Primary Reserve, and 30-Minute Reserve Services.</li> <li> <strong>Non-Synchronized Reserve Product</strong>: offline resources that are able to respond in ten (10) minutes or less. The Non-Synchronized Reserve product can satisfy the Primary Reserve and 30-Minute Reserve Services.</li> <li> <strong>Secondary Reserve Product</strong>: online or offline resources that are able to respond between ten (10) and thirty (30) minutes. The Secondary Reserve product can satisfy only the 30-Minute Reserve Service.</li> </ul> <p><strong>NYISO Markets</strong> by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2024clean"></d-cite></p> <p>Each of the NYISO-administered markets are interdependent and facilitate a different piece of the reliability puzzle :</p> <ol> <li>The <strong>Capacity Market</strong> secures commitments from supply resources to be available to meet seasonal resource adequacy requirements.</li> <li>The <strong>Energy Market</strong> secures electricity production to meet demand in real-time.</li> <li>The <strong>Ancillary Market</strong> secures flexibility services from suppliers to maintain balance in response to changing conditions on the electrical grid.</li> </ol> <p><strong>NYISO Operating Reserves</strong> by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2024ancillary"></d-cite> (p41)</p> <ul> <li> <strong>10-Minute Spinning Reserve</strong>: Operating Reserves provided by qualified Resources located within the NYCA that are already synchronized to the NYS Power System and can respond to instructions from the NYISO to change output level within 10 minutes.

Operating Reserves may also be provided by Demand Side Resources where the demand response is provided by a Local Generator or by Behind-the-Meter Net Generation Resources that are comprised of more than one generating unit that are dispatched as an aggregate unit.</li> <li> <strong>30-Minute Spinning Reserve</strong>: Operating Reserves provided by qualified Resources except Behind-the-Meter Net Generation Resources that are comprised of more than one generating unit and dispatched as a single aggregate unit located within the NYCA that are already synchronized to the NYS Power System and can respond to instructions from the NYISO to change output level within 30 minutes.</li> <li> <strong>30-Minute Non-Synchronized Reserve</strong> (30-Minute NSR): Operating reserves that can be provided by Resources, Behind-the-Meter Net Generation Resources that are comprised of more than one generating unit that are dispatched as an aggregate unit, that can be started, synchronized, and loaded within 30 minutes. Operating Reserves may also be provided by Demand Side Resources where the demand response is provided by a Local Generator.</li> <li> <strong>Total 10-Minute Reserve</strong>: The sum of the 10-Minute Spinning Reserve and 10-Minute NSR.

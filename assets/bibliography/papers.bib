  experienced simultaneous load losses of this magnitude in response to a fault on the system, which has 
  historically been planned for large generation losses but not for such significant simultaneous load losses. 
  Simultaneous large load losses have two effects on the electric system: First, frequency rises on the system 
  as a result of the imbalance between load and generation; second, voltage rises rapidly because less power 
  is flowing through the system. In this incident, the frequency did not rise to a level high enough to cause 
  concern. The voltage also did not rise to levels that posed a reliability risk, but operators did have to take 
  action to reduce the voltage to within normal operating levels. However, as the potential for this type of 
  load loss increases, the risk for frequency and voltage issues also increases. Operators and planners should 
  be aware of this reliability risk and ensure that these load losses do not reach intolerable levels.},

  cost- and carbon-aware load management, power provisioning and infrastructure rightsizing. They are simple, interpretable and
  exhibit uniformly high prediction accuracy in modeling power domains with large diversity of hardware configurations and workload
  types across Google fleet. A multi-year validation of the deployed models demonstrate that they can predict power with less
  than 5% Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) for more than 95% diverse PDUs across Google fleet. This performance matches the best
  reported accuracies coming from studies that focus on specific workload types, hardware platforms and, typically, more complex

  restrictions.
  NERC's ProbA is a compilation of 11 separate assessments conducted by five Regional Entities (REs) and six individual 
  assessment areas, covering the total 26 assessment areas. These studies varied in scope from the whole of WECC to 
  individual PCs (e.g., MISO, PJM, and SaskPower). These individual assessments were then combined into NERC's ProbA for 
  the whole NERC footprint. 
  A July 2012 conference call and a following formal letter in August that requested supporting information and data initiated 
  the 2012 ProbA. To minimize the burden on industry, the assessment was designed to coincide with the finalization of the 
  data for the 2012 LTRA. The analysis was conducted over the next six months with initial individual drafts due in December 
  2012 and final reports in February 2013. The final comprehensive NERC report combining these assessments will be 
  presented for the approval of the NERC Planning Committee at its June 2013 meeting. Last year NERC conducted the Pilot 
  Probabilistic Assessment 2011,
  3 which was based on 2010 LTRA data; this initial effort was approved by the NERC Planning 
  Committee in June 2012. Only FRCC, the NPCC Assessment Areas, the SERC Assessment Areas, Manitoba, MISO, and PJM 
  were capable of conducting such studies as part of the pilot report. NERC compared the results of the pilot report and the 
  2012 ProbA for the areas in both studies.
  With the approval of the pilot report, the Planning Committee concluded that the probabilistic assessment complemented 
  and enhanced the efforts of the Reliability Assessment Subcommittee (RAS) and should be a biennial report with the

  probabilistic assessments covering all of the NERC Assessment Areas.},

  abstract = {In August 2017, the Department of Energy (DOE) issued a Staff Report to the Secretary on Electricity Markets and 
  Reliability (DOE Grid Report) regarding reliability and resilience in light of the changing energy environment.
  One recommendation in the DOE Grid Report stated that NERC should consider adding resilience to its mission and 
  broadening its scope to address resilience. In response to the DOE report and NERC assessments, the NERC Board of 
  Trustees (NERC Board) directed the Reliability Issues Steering Committee (RISC) to develop a framework for resilience 
  and examine resilience in today's environment. At the November 2017 NERC Board Meeting, Board Chair, Mr. Roy 
  Thilly commented that, “Resilience is already built into what NERC does, and NERC is not looking to expand scope but 
  rather to examine resilience more closely. The NERC Board requested that the RISC report back with a framework on 
  how to think about resiliency in the context of reliability.”
  In accordance with the NERC Board's directive, the RISC has worked with NERC stakeholders to reexamine the 
  meaning of resilience in today's changing environment and how resilience impacts NERC activities. Meanwhile, the 
  DOE and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) have continued evaluating the relationship of resilience and 
  reliability. This report summarizes the results of the RISC's examination of resilience, including the RISC Resilience 
  Framework.
  Since its inception and consistent with section 215 of the FPA, NERC has focused on the grid's ability to withstand
  and manage event impacts, and respond to emerging issues and risks to ensure the Reliable Operation of the BPS.
  Resilience is a performance characteristic of the Reliable Operation of the BPS and a critical part of ERO Enterprise 
  activities. Per its statutory mission, NERC has an essential leadership role in identifying and mitigating evolving and 
  emerging risks to reliability. Further, as a learning industry, NERC supports sharing of lessons learned and monitors 
  system performance to identify evolving and emerging risks. Through its subject authority over Bulk Electric System 
  (BES) reliability and its reliability programs, NERC can identify and share ways industry can increase resiliency of the 
  BES to resist anticipated threats.
  In particular, NERC must develop and enforce Reliability Standards for Reliable Operation on the BES of the BPS and 
  conduct periodic assessments of the reliability and adequacy of the BPS in North America. For more than 50 years, 
  “reliability” for the BPS has been defined to consist of two fundamental and aspirational concepts: adequacy and
  operating reliability.},

  abstract = {A key issue in creating the next generation of energy management system (EMS) and advanced distribution management
  system (ADMS) platforms will be the ability to represent and exchange power system network model data in a consistent manner. To
  this end, the Common Information Model (CIM) stands out as the only standardized vocabulary (or ontology) for defining power system
  network models and asset data in a comprehensive, consistent manner across the generation-transmission-distribution boundary. The
  CIM is freely available to use and extend. The CIM is maintained by the UCAiug (informally known as the CIM User's Group) under
  an Apache 2.0 license. The CIM Users Group collaborates with the IEC and other standards communities for the development of technical
  and informative specifications. Although portions of the information model are referred to by the corresponding IEC standards naming,
  it is not necessary to purchase any of the IEC standards to use the CIM information model. This document provides a roadmap for power
  system engineers and application developers not familiar with semantic modeling to start using the CIM for modeling, simulation,
  optimization, and development of advanced power applications. The key classes needed for defining power system topology and equipment
  are explained systematically. Key focus areas include modeling of lines, transformers, generators, switching equipment, loads, and
  distributed energy resources (DERs).},

  The basics of Unified Modeling Language are explained for readers new to the language of the CIM. Building from examples of commonly
  understood objects, the concepts underlying the CIM are introduced in a step-by-step fashion. This conceptual understanding prepares the
  reader for an introduction to the complexities of electric power system modelling and data exchange approaches. The seventh addition expands
  upon Section 8, going into detail about other tools for generating schema from the CIM UML and addressing updates to these tools that have
  added support for JSON Schema generation.
  Learning aids include questions and answers to reinforce learning of key CIM concepts, as well as case studies illustrating how utilities
  and vendors leverage the CIM for business benefit.},

  equivalently from the Lyapunov direct criterion; and using this equation to derive one-shot stability analysis strategies.
  A technique for system admittance matrix reduction is developed that proves efficient, especially for large systems
  and multiple-contingency evaluation. The method's main appeal is rapidity: it is about one order of magnitude faster than
  the most efficient direct criterion. Other attractive features are flexibility and ability to encompass various simulation
  conditions. Extensions to online sensitivity analysis and control are suggested.},

  The complexity of power systems is continually increasing because of the growth in interconnections and use of new technologies.
  At the same time, financial and regulatory constraints have forced utilities to operate the systems nearly at stability limits.
  These two factors have created new types of stability problems. Greater reliance is, therefore, being placed on the use of special
  control aids to enhance system security, facilitate economic design, and provide greater flexibility of system operation.
  In addition, advances in computer technology, numerical analysis, control theory, and equipment modelling have contributed to
  the development of improved analytical tools and better system-design procedures. The primary motivation for writing this book
  has been to describe these new developments and to provide a comprehensive treatment of the subject.},

  of machine learning methodology. In line with the statistical tradition, uncertainty has long been perceived
  as almost synonymous with standard probability and probabilistic predictions. Yet, due to the steadily increasing
  relevance of machine learning for practical applications and related issues such as safety requirements, new
  problems and challenges have recently been identified by machine learning scholars, and these problems may
  call for new methodological developments. In particular, this includes the importance of distinguishing between
  (at least) two different types of uncertainty, often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic. In this paper, we
  provide an introduction to the topic of uncertainty in machine learning as well as an overview of attempts so far
  at handling uncertainty in general and formalizing this distinction in particular.},

  present in power systems dominated by synchronous machines and their controls. Since that time, the dynamic behavior of power systems
  has gradually changed due to the increasing penetration of converter interfaced generation technologies, loads, and transmission devices
  and has progressively become more dependent on (complex) fast-response power electronic devices, thus arising new stability concerns.
  In recognition of this change, a Task Force was established by IEEE PSDPC in 2016 to re-examine and extend, where appropriate, the classic
  definitions and classifications of the basic stability terms. This report summarizes the results of this work and presents extended
  definitions, characterization and classification of power system stability.},

  performance and transient stability, an all-in-one load data center power emulator is developed on a reconfigurable
  PE converter-based hardware testbed (HTB). The dynamic power model is digitized and simplified to be implemented in
  two local voltage source inverters on the HTB. This proposed data center power emulator has been verified experimentally
  in a regional network. Dynamic performances during voltage sag events and server load variations are emulated and

  abstract = {The concept of synchro-waveforms has recently emerged as a promising frontier in power system monitoring and
  data-driven applications. By providing access to raw waveform samples, synchro-waveforms can capture not only the typical
  major disturbances but also the seemingly minor, yet sometimes highly informative, disturbances in voltage and current
  that are missed by other time-synchronized measurements, such as synchrophasors. As a result, synchro-waveforms can support a
  wide range of existing and new measurement-based applications in power system monitoring, control, and protection. However,
  several open issues remain in this field. The true value of synchro-waveforms has yet to be fully realized. At the same
  time, their much higher data volume and faster reporting rate compared to synchrophasors introduce new challenges in power
  system data analytics that must be addressed. This technical report identifies and addresses some of these challenges through
  a collaborative effort. It explores currently available technologies and case studies in this rapidly evolving area, while
  also examining future needs in data handling, standardization, and real-time processing capabilities. Specifically, the
  chapters in this report cover the following core subjects: synchro-waveform technology and infrastructure; data collection,
  storage, and communication; different forms of synchro-waveform data representation; basic methods for working with
  synchro-waveform data; case studies and future applications; and synchro-waveform standardization needs. This report was
  prepared with contributions from a diverse group of individuals with varying expertise. While some sections reflect on
  well-understood concepts, many sections seek to explore preliminary ideas. Together, these contributions provide valuable
  insights and suggestions for future directions in this field. This report serves as a resource for industry, academia, and
  all stakeholders interested in leveraging synchro-waveform data for enhanced situational awareness and other power system
  applications. Its ultimate goal is to raise awareness within the power systems community and related disciplines about the
  growing field of synchro-waveforms and the diverse range of emerging topics in this domain.},

  enhancements are needed to maintain safety and reliability. At low levels of DER penetration, the hosting capacity of the local electric

  hosting capacity is not a static value as it is dependent on the coincidence of several factors that vary over the course of a day, season
  and/or year. As the remaining hosting capacity shrinks with rising DER penetrations there is interest in utilizing the additional hosting
  capacity that is available outside of those worst-case conditions. Capabilities to utilize more “flexible” DER interconnections (for both
  generation and demand resources) that can be managed in concert and controlled dynamically will likely become a viable means to maximize
  the use of DER within the operating limits of the grid.},

  networks. In the first stage, Distribution System State Estimation (DSSE) and Capacity Constrained State Optimisation (CCSO) techniques
  are employed to allocate DOEs at transformer connection points. Using network data from available metering infrastructure, DSSE estimates
  the current operational state of the network, whereas CCSO facilitates the DOE allocations at transformer connection points considering
  technical, soft-equitable and equitable perspectives. In the second stage, the allocated DOEs, containing available aggregate export/import
  power, are distributed among DERs of LV networks ensuring network integrity. Real-world data of an Australian MV-LV network is employed
  to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed approach. Test results show that technical perspective can offer maximum allocated export/import
  power, whereas, minimum disparity of allocated power among different connection-points is attained for equitable perspective. Further,
  insightful performance studies of DOE and existing fixed export policies are conducted considering the condition of present as well as
  future power systems expecting substantial proliferations of renewables.},

  a safe and reliable operation while enabling consumers to trade their flexibility in the wholesale market. To enable this, we obtain
  network-secure operating envelopes that facilitate participation of consumers in energy and reserve markets. Given the distributed
  nature of the real-world problem, we use the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to optimise for operating envelopes
  such that any market action of consumers within these envelopes satisfies the distribution network constraints. To guarantee that
  the uncertainty realisation in live operation neither leads to network infeasibilities (due to exceeding the operating envelope)
  nor penalises DER-owners (due to market bid violation), we introduce a piecewise affinely adjustable robust bidding approach that
  can compensate for uncertainty variations in real-time. We also open up network capacity and minimise its losses, by proposing an
  additional piecewise affine Q-P controller that exchanges inverter reactive power with the grid. Our results on a 69-bus distribution
  network highlight the effectiveness of our proposal compared to alternative approaches.},

  additional balancing needs in real-time. Addressing those needs cost-effectively and reliably within a competitive market with
  unbundled products is challenging as both the demand for and the availability of flexibility depends on day-ahead energy schedules.
  Existing approaches for reserve procurement usually rely either on oversimplified demand curves that do not consider how system
  conditions that particular day affect the value of flexibility, or on bilateral trading of hedging instruments that are not
  co-optimized with day-ahead schedules. This article presents and analyzes a new product, 'Flexibility Options', which system
  operators could consider to address these two limitations. The demand for this product is endogenously determined in the day-ahead
  market and it is met cost-effectively by considering real-time supply curves for product providers, which are co-optimized with the
  energy supply. As we illustrate with numerical examples and mathematical analysis, the product addresses the hedging needs of
  participants with imbalances cost-effectively, provides a less intermittent revenue stream for participants with flexible outputs,
  promotes value-driven pricing of flexibility, and ensures that the system operator is revenue-neutral. This article provides a

  System operators need to account for such uncertainties when solving the unit commitment and economic dispatch problem. The research
  literature has proposed advanced methods for decision making under uncertainty but, in practice, actual system operators put more trust in the
  tried-and-true approach of dealing with future uncertainty by committing reserves. In this paper, the unit commitment and economic dispatch
  problem is formulated for a system with high penetration of storage and the inadequacy of methods based on the traditional notion of reserves is
  exposed. Namely, in contrast to a generator, a storage unit can provide reserve capacity in a number of timeslots but it cannot provide an analogous
  reserve activation in all of those timeslots due to the battery's energy being depleted. After discussing two plausible but inadequate approaches,
  a new, generalized notion of reserves is proposed, which addresses these issues while not abandoning the practical, reserve-based approach for
  the operator's problem, thus making the best of both worlds. The proposed scheme enables storage units to provide reserves, without putting the
  system at risk of energy scarcity, which is shown to result in substantial cost savings.},

  periods: from 1970 to 1990 and from 1990 to the present. The initial period is typically defined by a centralized power system framework
  that prevailed around the world. The latter observes a transition to a decentralized structure in a market environment, marked by an
  increasing integration of renewables and advanced technologies, in addition to maintaining a centralized power system structure for some
  countries. Since we review the broad topic of power systems optimization, this analysis focuses on the main power system problems — investment,
  operation planning, operations, control, and forecasting — to define the main research streams. We provide a thorough exploration of the
  operations research methods applied to specific problem types within each period. Thus, this review not only underscores the pivotal role
  of operations research in addressing the challenges posed by changing landscapes and advanced technologies but also unveils the transformative
  journey of power systems optimization along with future research directions.},

  abstract = {The performance of various components in a power system, from voltage stability perspective, is highly dependent on the system
  strength. Voltage stability issues can be caused by integrating a large amount of wind generation into a weak grid. Short circuit ratio
  (SCR) is often used as an index of the system strength. SCR provides wind plants a reference to properly tune controller settings and coordinate
  with neighboring plants. The commonly used SCR calculation method does not consider interactions between wind plants, therefore gives an
  overly-optimistic estimation of the system strength. This paper proposes the concept of weighted short circuit ratio (WSCR), which takes interactions
  between wind plants into account. The WSCR can better reflect the actual system strength when integrating a large amount of wind plants in a weak
  system. The paper also proposes a procedure to determine the optimal synchronous condenser ratings and locations to improve the overall system strength.},

  stability issues such as small signal instability may occur when these resources are connected to a grid with low strength, i.e., a weak grid.
  In this paper, the relationships between small signal stability and grid strength measured with short circuit ratio (SCR), along with the relationships
  between the stability boundary and critical SCR (CSCR) are analytically studied in a single-infeed power electronic system (SIPES). On this basis,
  these relationships are extended to a multi-infeed power electronic system (MIPES) through eigenvalue decomposition techniques to define the so-called
  generalized short circuit ratio (gSCR) and critical gSCR (CgSCR) for small signal stability analysis. The defined gSCR and CgSCR are the generalized
  representation of SCR and CSCR for SIPESs in MIPESs. The gSCR can assess the grid strength of a MIPES in terms of its small signal stability while
  the CgSCR can characterize the stability boundary of a MIPES. In addition, the condition of CgSCR = CSCR is satisfied for a MIPES with homogeneous
  power electronic devices. This enables the proposed method based on the gSCR to simplify the complex stability analysis of MIPESs into the stability
  study of SIPESs. The efficacy of the proposed gSCR and CgSCR is validated with eigenvalue analysis and time-domain simulations.},

  and provide four categories of classification for current energy-equity research: quantifying energy equity, improving equity in the accessibility of
  electricity, improving equity in the affordability of electricity, and improving equity in the resilience of power systems. We then set out a roadmap to

  is not self-sufficient. Mathematical models have to be translated into computer programming code in order to be analyzed, understood and

  this framework with versatile programming code. This book is for all students and researchers that are looking for a quick reference on power
  system models or need some guidelines for starting the challenging adventure of writing their own code.},

  Abstract and operational definitions for human and artificial intelligence are proposed that emphasize maximal capacity for completing
  novel goals successfully through respective perceptual-cognitive and computational processes. Additionally, support for considering
  intelligence, both human and artificial, as consistent with a multidimensional model of capabilities is provided. The implications
  of current practices in artificial intelligence training and testing are also described, as they can be expected to lead to artificial
  achievement or expertise rather than artificial intelligence. Paralleling psychometrics, ‘AI metrics’ is suggested as a needed computer
  science discipline that acknowledges the importance of test reliability and validity, as well as standardized measurement procedures in
  artificial system evaluations. Drawing parallels with human general intelligence, artificial general intelligence (AGI) is described as
  a reflection of the shared variance in artificial system performances. We conclude that current evidence more greatly supports the
  observation of artificial achievement and expertise over artificial intelligence. However, interdisciplinary collaborations, based on
  common understandings of the nature of intelligence, as well as sound measurement practices, could facilitate scientific innovations
  that help bridge the gap between artificial and human-like intelligence.},

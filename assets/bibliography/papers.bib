  voltage-sensitive load that was not anticipated by the BES operators. The electric grid has not historically
  experienced simultaneous load losses of this magnitude in response to a fault on the system, which has 
  historically been planned for large generation losses but not for such significant simultaneous load losses. 
  Simultaneous large load losses have two effects on the electric system: First, frequency rises on the system 
  as a result of the imbalance between load and generation; second, voltage rises rapidly because less power 
  is flowing through the system. In this incident, the frequency did not rise to a level high enough to cause 
  concern. The voltage also did not rise to levels that posed a reliability risk, but operators did have to take 
  action to reduce the voltage to within normal operating levels. However, as the potential for this type of 
  load loss increases, the risk for frequency and voltage issues also increases. Operators and planners should 
  be aware of this reliability risk and ensure that these load losses do not reach intolerable levels.},

  This paper presents two types of statistical power models that relate CPU usage of Google's Power Distribution Units (PDUs,
  commonly referred to as power domains) to their power consumption. The models are deployed in production and are used for
  cost- and carbon-aware load management, power provisioning and infrastructure rightsizing. They are simple, interpretable and
  exhibit uniformly high prediction accuracy in modeling power domains with large diversity of hardware configurations and workload
  types across Google fleet. A multi-year validation of the deployed models demonstrate that they can predict power with less
  than 5% Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) for more than 95% diverse PDUs across Google fleet. This performance matches the best
  reported accuracies coming from studies that focus on specific workload types, hardware platforms and, typically, more complex

  assessment areas, different base case data may have been used due to the vintage of the data available or other analytical 
  restrictions.
  NERC's ProbA is a compilation of 11 separate assessments conducted by five Regional Entities (REs) and six individual 
  assessment areas, covering the total 26 assessment areas. These studies varied in scope from the whole of WECC to 
  individual PCs (e.g., MISO, PJM, and SaskPower). These individual assessments were then combined into NERC's ProbA for 
  the whole NERC footprint. 
  A July 2012 conference call and a following formal letter in August that requested supporting information and data initiated 
  the 2012 ProbA. To minimize the burden on industry, the assessment was designed to coincide with the finalization of the 
  data for the 2012 LTRA. The analysis was conducted over the next six months with initial individual drafts due in December 
  2012 and final reports in February 2013. The final comprehensive NERC report combining these assessments will be 
  presented for the approval of the NERC Planning Committee at its June 2013 meeting. Last year NERC conducted the Pilot 
  Probabilistic Assessment 2011,
  3 which was based on 2010 LTRA data; this initial effort was approved by the NERC Planning 
  Committee in June 2012. Only FRCC, the NPCC Assessment Areas, the SERC Assessment Areas, Manitoba, MISO, and PJM 
  were capable of conducting such studies as part of the pilot report. NERC compared the results of the pilot report and the 
  2012 ProbA for the areas in both studies.
  With the approval of the pilot report, the Planning Committee concluded that the probabilistic assessment complemented 
  and enhanced the efforts of the Reliability Assessment Subcommittee (RAS) and should be a biennial report with the 
  participation of all assessment areas across the whole NERC footprint. This is the first such report in the series of 
  probabilistic assessments covering all of the NERC Assessment Areas.},

  abstract = {In August 2017, the Department of Energy (DOE) issued a Staff Report to the Secretary on Electricity Markets and 
  Reliability (DOE Grid Report) regarding reliability and resilience in light of the changing energy environment.
  One recommendation in the DOE Grid Report stated that NERC should consider adding resilience to its mission and 
  broadening its scope to address resilience. In response to the DOE report and NERC assessments, the NERC Board of 
  Trustees (NERC Board) directed the Reliability Issues Steering Committee (RISC) to develop a framework for resilience 
  and examine resilience in today's environment. At the November 2017 NERC Board Meeting, Board Chair, Mr. Roy 
  Thilly commented that, “Resilience is already built into what NERC does, and NERC is not looking to expand scope but 
  rather to examine resilience more closely. The NERC Board requested that the RISC report back with a framework on 
  how to think about resiliency in the context of reliability.”
  In accordance with the NERC Board's directive, the RISC has worked with NERC stakeholders to reexamine the 
  meaning of resilience in today's changing environment and how resilience impacts NERC activities. Meanwhile, the 
  DOE and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) have continued evaluating the relationship of resilience and 
  reliability. This report summarizes the results of the RISC's examination of resilience, including the RISC Resilience 
  Framework.
  Since its inception and consistent with section 215 of the FPA, NERC has focused on the grid's ability to withstand
  and manage event impacts, and respond to emerging issues and risks to ensure the Reliable Operation of the BPS.
  Resilience is a performance characteristic of the Reliable Operation of the BPS and a critical part of ERO Enterprise 
  activities. Per its statutory mission, NERC has an essential leadership role in identifying and mitigating evolving and 
  emerging risks to reliability. Further, as a learning industry, NERC supports sharing of lessons learned and monitors 
  system performance to identify evolving and emerging risks. Through its subject authority over Bulk Electric System 
  (BES) reliability and its reliability programs, NERC can identify and share ways industry can increase resiliency of the 
  BES to resist anticipated threats.
  In particular, NERC must develop and enforce Reliability Standards for Reliable Operation on the BES of the BPS and 
  conduct periodic assessments of the reliability and adequacy of the BPS in North America. For more than 50 years, 
  “reliability” for the BPS has been defined to consist of two fundamental and aspirational concepts: adequacy and
  operating reliability.},

  abstract = {A key issue in creating the next generation of energy management system (EMS) and advanced distribution management
  system (ADMS) platforms will be the ability to represent and exchange power system network model data in a consistent manner. To
  this end, the Common Information Model (CIM) stands out as the only standardized vocabulary (or ontology) for defining power system
  network models and asset data in a comprehensive, consistent manner across the generation-transmission-distribution boundary. The
  CIM is freely available to use and extend. The CIM is maintained by the UCAiug (informally known as the CIM User's Group) under
  an Apache 2.0 license. The CIM Users Group collaborates with the IEC and other standards communities for the development of technical
  and informative specifications. Although portions of the information model are referred to by the corresponding IEC standards naming,
  it is not necessary to purchase any of the IEC standards to use the CIM information model. This document provides a roadmap for power
  system engineers and application developers not familiar with semantic modeling to start using the CIM for modeling, simulation,
  optimization, and development of advanced power applications. The key classes needed for defining power system topology and equipment
  are explained systematically. Key focus areas include modeling of lines, transformers, generators, switching equipment, loads, and
  distributed energy resources (DERs).},

  The primer explains how the CIM originated and was developed through the years, with the support of working groups of Technical Committee
  57 of the International Electrotechnical Commission.
  The basics of Unified Modeling Language are explained for readers new to the language of the CIM. Building from examples of commonly
  understood objects, the concepts underlying the CIM are introduced in a step-by-step fashion. This conceptual understanding prepares the
  reader for an introduction to the complexities of electric power system modelling and data exchange approaches. The seventh addition expands
  upon Section 8, going into detail about other tools for generating schema from the CIM UML and addressing updates to these tools that have
  added support for JSON Schema generation.
  Learning aids include questions and answers to reinforce learning of key CIM concepts, as well as case studies illustrating how utilities
  and vendors leverage the CIM for business benefit.},

  equivalently from the Lyapunov direct criterion; and using this equation to derive one-shot stability analysis strategies.
  A technique for system admittance matrix reduction is developed that proves efficient, especially for large systems
  and multiple-contingency evaluation. The method's main appeal is rapidity: it is about one order of magnitude faster than
  the most efficient direct criterion. Other attractive features are flexibility and ability to encompass various simulation

  relevance of machine learning for practical applications and related issues such as safety requirements, new
  problems and challenges have recently been identified by machine learning scholars, and these problems may
  call for new methodological developments. In particular, this includes the importance of distinguishing between
  (at least) two different types of uncertainty, often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic. In this paper, we

  issue of stability definition and classification in power systems from a fundamental viewpoint and had closely examined the practical
  ramifications. The relevant report published in 2004, primarily dealt with fairly slow, electromechanical phenomena, typically
  present in power systems dominated by synchronous machines and their controls. Since that time, the dynamic behavior of power systems
  has gradually changed due to the increasing penetration of converter interfaced generation technologies, loads, and transmission devices
  and has progressively become more dependent on (complex) fast-response power electronic devices, thus arising new stability concerns.
  In recognition of this change, a Task Force was established by IEEE PSDPC in 2016 to re-examine and extend, where appropriate, the classic
  definitions and classifications of the basic stability terms. This report summarizes the results of this work and presents extended
  definitions, characterization and classification of power system stability.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the recovery of the voltage after a voltage dip due to a fault in a three-phase system. The instant of voltage
  recovery corresponds to the instant of fault clearing. For single-phase and phase-to-phase faults, a single point-on-wave of voltage recovery can
  be defined. For two-phase-to-ground and three-phase faults, the recovery takes place in two or three steps. The voltage recovery is described in
  a systematic way by using a classification of three-phase unbalanced voltage dips. The voltage recovery needs to be modeled correctly for studies
  of equipment immunity against voltage dips.},

  abstract={Data centers have become a widespread power electronics (PE) load, which has significant impact on the
  power grid. In order to investigate the data center load characteristics, this article proposes a complete dynamic model
  for a typical data center ac power distribution system. A generalized model with mode transition is proposed to
  coordinate different power stages in the data center power system. Meanwhile, to help evaluate the grid dynamic
  performance and transient stability, an all-in-one load data center power emulator is developed on a reconfigurable
  PE converter-based hardware testbed (HTB). The dynamic power model is digitized and simplified to be implemented in
  two local voltage source inverters on the HTB. This proposed data center power emulator has been verified experimentally
  in a regional network. Dynamic performances during voltage sag events and server load variations are emulated and
  discussed. The article details the design, development, and verification of the data center model and power emulator.
  The proposed model and emulator provide an effective, easy-to-use tool to better design data centers and study the
  interaction with the power system.},

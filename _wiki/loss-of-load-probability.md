### Definition by NERC

Source: <d-cite key="nerc2013probabilistic"></d-cite>

> Loss-of-Load Probability (LOLP) is the **probability** of system demand exceeding the generating capacity during a given period.
> If LOLP is the number of days on which there is expected to be a shortfall per year, it is the same as LOLE.
> However, other definitions of LOLP are also used.

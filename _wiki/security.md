### Definition in an Article by a Joint Task Force of IEEE and CIGRE

Source: <d-cite key="kundur2004stability"></d-cite>

> Security of a power system refers to the degree of risk in its ability to survive imminent disturbances (contingencies) without interruption of customer service.
> It relates to robustness of the system to imminent disturbances and, hence, depends on the system operating condition as well as the contingent probability of disturbances.

> 电力系统安全性：电力系统在运行中承受扰动（例如突然失去电力系统的元件，较大功率波动或短路故障等）的能力。 通过两个特性表征：
>
> a) 电力系统能承受住扰动引起的暂态过程并过渡到一个可接受的运行工况；
>
> b) 在新的运行工况下，各种约束条件得到满足。

Power System Security: The ability of a power system to withstand disturbances during operation (such as the sudden loss of system components, significant power fluctuations, or short-circuit faults). It is characterized by two specific attributes: 

a) The power system can withstand the transient processes caused by the disturbance and transition to an acceptable operating state;

b) Under the new operating state, various constraints are satisfied.

**Security** <d-cite key="kundur2004stability"></d-cite>

Security of a power system refers to the degree of risk in its ability to survive imminent disturbances (contingencies) without interruption of customer service.
It relates to robustness of the system to imminent disturbances and, hence, depends on the system operating condition as well as the contingent probability of disturbances.

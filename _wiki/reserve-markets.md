> The PJM Reserve Markets provide PJM participants with a market-based system for the purchase and sale of the Synchronized Reserve, Primary Reserve, and 30-minute Reserve Services (“Reserves”).
> The PJM Reserve Markets are conducted in both the Day-ahead Market and Real-time Market processes.
> In the Day-ahead Market, PJM schedules Reserves on a simultaneously, co-optimized basis with Energy for each hour of the next Operating Day.
>
> In Real-time, PJM procures Reserves on a simultaneously, co-optimized basis with Energy for each hour and each interval. Both the Day-ahead and Real-time Reserve Markets are offer-based and procure resources to meet the required Reserve Services:

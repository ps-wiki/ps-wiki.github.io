> Provides and operates the “wires” between the transmission system and the end-use customer. For those end-use customers who are served at transmission voltages, the Transmission Owner also serves as the Distribution Provider. Thus, theDistribution Provider is not defined by a specific voltage, but rather as performing the distribution function at any voltage.

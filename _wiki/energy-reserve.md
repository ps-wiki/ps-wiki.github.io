> Core Idea: If the storage is allowed to offer its whole energy as reserve in each timeslot (as in Example 1), but an additional notion of reserve is introduced to make sure that there are sufficient energy reserves across timeslots to maintain the probability of balancing energy scarcity below a desired threshold, then the operator can find a dispatch (such as the one in Table IV below) that satisfies the security constraints at a fraction of the conservative solution's (Example 2) cost.

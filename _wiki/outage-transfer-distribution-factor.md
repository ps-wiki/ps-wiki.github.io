> An OTDF is similar to PTDF, except an OTDF provides a linearized approximation of the **post-outage change** in flow on a transmission line in response to a transaction between the Seller and the Buyer. The OTDF value is a function of PTDF values and LODF values.

Calculations can be found in the source reference.

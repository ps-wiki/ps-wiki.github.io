> Refer generally to BPS-connected facilities that have a power electronic interface between the AC grid and the source of electricity.

Two clarifications from the source reference are excerpted here:

> **What types of IBR exist?**
>
> Inverter-based resources include modern wind turbines, meaning type 3 and type 4 wind turbines, solar photovoltaic, and battery energy storage resources, as well as HVDC circuits and FACTs devices like static synchronous compensators and static volt-ampere reactive compensators.

> **What is the difference between IBR and DER?**
>
> - [DER](/wiki/distributed-energy-resources) are generating resources located on the **distribution** system.
> - DER **may or may not** use inverter technology to interface with the AC grid; however, they are distinctly different than BPS-connected inverter-based resources (connected to transmission and sub-transmission levels).

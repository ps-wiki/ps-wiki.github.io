> Voltage stability refers to the ability of a power system to maintain steady voltages close to nominal value at all buses in the system after being subjected to a disturbance.

> Short-term voltage stability involves dynamics of fast acting load components such as induction motors, electronically controlled loads, HVDC links and inverter-based generators. The study period of interest is in the order of several seconds, similar to rotor angle stability or converter-driven stability (slow interaction type). Accordingly, models with the same degree of detail as for the above stability classes must be used. In addition, for short-term voltage stability, the dynamic modeling of loads is essential, and short circuit faults near loads are the main concern.

> Long-term voltage stability involves slower acting equipment such as tap-changing transformers, thermostatically controlled loads, and generator current limiters. It usually occurs in the form of a progressive reduction of voltages at some network buses. The maximum power transfer and voltage support are further limited when some of the generators hit their field and/or armature current time-overload capability limits. The study period of interest may extend to several minutes, and long-term simulations are required for analysis of system dynamic performance.

### Defintion in an IEEE Article

Source: <d-cite key="ieee1980subsynchronous"></d-cite>

> Subsynchronous resonance is an electric power system condition where the electric network exchanges energy with a turbine generator at one or more of the natural frequencies of the combined system below the synchronous frequency of the system.
>
> Subsynchronous resonance encompasses the oscillatory attributes of electrical and mechanical variables associated with turbine-generators when coupled to a series capacitor compensated transmission system, where the oscillatory energy interchange between the electric system and the turbine generator is lightly damped, undamped, or even negatively damped and growing.
> The terms **subsynchronous** and **supersynchronous** are used to denote frequencies below and above the synchronous frequency defined by rotor average speed.

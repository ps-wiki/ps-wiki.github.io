> Line Outage Distribution Factors (LODFs) are a sensitivity measure of how a change in a lineâ€™s status affects the flows on other lines in the system. On an energized line, the LODF calculation determines the percentage of the present line flow that will show up on other transmission lines after the outage of the line.

Calculations can be found in the source reference.

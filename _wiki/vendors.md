Some software vendors for the power engineering are listed below:

#### EMTP

Electromagnetic transients program (EMTP) is the reference for EMT simulations and analysis of power systems.

- Load-Flow: EMTP has a very powerful unbalanced multi-phase load-flow solver capable of solving very large scale transmission and distribution grids, cases with more than 300000 buses can be solved.
- Time-Domain: EMTP provides the most accurate, numerically stable, and consistent time-domain EMT simulations.
- Steady-State: The electrical network equations are solved using complex phasors. This option can be used in the stand-alone mode or for initializing the time-domain solution. A harmonic steady-state solution can be achieved.
- Frequency-Scan: A frequency scan simulation is available with EMTP to determine the system impedance and to identify any possible resonance frequencies within the system.

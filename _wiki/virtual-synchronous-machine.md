### Definition in an IEEE Standard

Source: <d-cite key="ieee2025std2988"></d-cite>

> A virtual synchronous machine is a piece of equipment that includes a DC/AC power electronic converter (PEC) controlled to mimic and, in some cases, to surpass the dynamics and behavior of a conventional [synchronous machine (SM)](/wiki/synchronous-machine) through the inherent [synchronization mechanism](/wiki/synchronization) of SM.

> virtual damping: The damping effect that is implemented through a control function.

> virtual impedance: The impedance that is implemented through a control function.

> virtual inertia: The inertia that is implemented through a control function to emulate the physical inertia of an SM

### Definition by FERC

> A venue where participants buy and sell products or services.
>
> Usually there is agreement of product description and some standard terms to enable determination of value and price.

### Definition by NESO

> In an economic sense, markets enable the exchange of goods or services. They involve transactions between buyers and sellers, either directly or through mediating institutions.
>
> Markets can be literal, like a chain grocery store or local farmers’ market, where buyers can purchase commodities from vendors. In wider systems, however, markets can span beyond physical places. The real estate market and electricity market, for example, include wide geographical areas in which sellers compete.

### Markets in NYISO

> Each of the NYISO-administered markets are interdependent and facilitate a different piece of the reliability puzzle :
>
> 1. The **Capacity Market** secures commitments from supply resources to be available to meet seasonal resource adequacy requirements.
> 2. The **Energy Market** secures electricity production to meet demand in real-time.
> 3. The **Ancillary Market** secures flexibility services from suppliers to maintain balance in response to changing conditions on the electrical grid.

### Markets in PJM

> The PJM Energy Markets consists of two markets, a Day-ahead Market and a Real-time Balancing Market. In general, both markets follow a two-step process to perform dispatch and pricing of the system. First, security-constrained economic dispatch of the system is performed, referred to as the dispatch run. Second, the calculation of Locational Marginal Prices is performed separately and subsequent to the dispatch run, referred to as the pricing run. The objective of both the dispatch run and the pricing run is to serve load and meet reserve requirements at the least cost while evaluating the same transmission constraints.
>
> In the pricing run, however, Integer Relaxation is performed to allow Eligible Fast-Start Resources that are online in the dispatch run, to set price as well as to incorporate their associated commitment costs. Integer Relaxation allows Eligible Fast-Start Resources that generally do not have wide dispatchable ranges to be fully dispatchable between zero and their Economic Maximum. Resources cannot be committed in the pricing run if they were not committed in the dispatch run. This in turn allows the optimization problem in the pricing run to use a fraction of a committed Eligible Fast-Start Resource’s output, including an amount less than the resource’s offered economic minimum output, in the determination of Locational Marginal Prices.

> There are several different markets operating across GB’s electricity system, some of the key ones being:
> - **Wholesale electricity markets** include the sale and purchase of electricity between suppliers and generators. 
> - **Retail electricity markets** involve suppliers selling electricity direct to consumers. 
> - **Balancing mechanism market** refers to how the NESO balances real-time supply and demand through the Balancing Mechanism.
> - **Balancing services market** include the range of services across the NESO that ensure the security and quality of electricity supply across GB’s transmission system.

> Each of the NYISO-administered markets are interdependent and facilitate a different piece of the reliability puzzle :
>
> 1. The **Capacity Market** secures commitments from supply resources to be available to meet seasonal resource adequacy requirements.
> 2. The **Energy Market** secures electricity production to meet demand in real-time.
> 3. The **Ancillary Market** secures flexibility services from suppliers to maintain balance in response to changing conditions on the electrical grid.

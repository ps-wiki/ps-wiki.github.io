This paper presents various aspects of the contingency usage at PJM including the applications that utilize contingency lists, 
modeling of contingencies and monitoring of contingency results.

A separate contingency list is utilized for each application. 
Many of the contingencies are common however each application may use a subset of contingencies and may also have contingencies that are of special interest.

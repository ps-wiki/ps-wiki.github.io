>
> 4.1 Represent All Control Loops in Detail
>
> 4.2 Represent All Control Features Pertinent to the Type of Study Being Done
>
> 4.3 Include Representation of Plant Level Controls or Multi-Plant Controllers, As Applicable
>
> 4.4 Represent All Pertinent Electrical and Mechanical Components
>
> 4.5 Have All Pertinent Protections Modeled in Detail
>
> 4.6 Model Must Be Configured to Match Site-Specific Equipment Settings

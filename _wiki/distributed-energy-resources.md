### Definition in an IEEE Standard

Source: <d-cite key="ieee2018std1547"></d-cite> p21

> A source of electric power that is not directly connected to a bulk power system. DER includes both generators and energy storage technologies capable of exporting active power to an EPS. An interconnection system or a supplemental DER device that is necessary for compliance with this standard is part of a DER. DER is equivalent to “distributed resources (DR)” as defined and used in IEEE Std 1547-2003.

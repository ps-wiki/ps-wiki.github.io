**Distributed Energy Resources** (DER) <d-cite key="ieee2018std1547"></d-cite> (p21) by IEEE

A source of electric power that is not directly connected to a bulk power system.
DER includes both generators and energy storage technologies capable of exporting active power to an EPS.
An interconnection system or a supplemental DER device that is necessary for compliance with this standard is part of a DER.
DER is equivalent to “distributed resources (DR)” as defined and used in IEEE Std 1547-2003.

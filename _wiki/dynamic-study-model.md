> The main target of the Dynamic Study Model was to setup a robust, simple, transparent and easily transferable dynamic model able to reproduce the same results with a high variety of dynamic simulation tools available and in use at the different CE TSOs.
> 
> For this purpose a load-flow model of the CE-system was expanded with standard models for generators and appropriate controller models in order to represent the dynamics of the interconnected CE power system. With defined criteria it is possible to choose, which generators should be taken into account for dynamic analysis. The following Figure 1.1 shows the concept of the Dynamic Study Model.

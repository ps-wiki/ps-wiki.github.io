Put simply, a dynamic operating envelope establishes the bounds within which a controlled resource (load or generation) can operate
for a given period of time and avoid adverse grid impacts.
The operating envelope is created by allocating the gridâ€™s marginal hosting capacity amongst the flexible resources.
Allocation of the marginal hosting capacity may utilize a uniform, proportional, or economic based approach.

A Dynamic Operating Envelope (DOE) specifies the available capacity to import/export power for Distributed Energy Resources (DERs)
or connection points of a distribution network in a time interval without violating its physical and operational constraints.

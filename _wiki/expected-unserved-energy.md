> Expected Unserved Energy (EUE) is a measure of the generation and transmission system’s capability to continuously serve all loads at all delivery points while satisfying all planning criteria.
> EUE is energy-centric and analyzes all hours of a particular year.
> Results are calculated in **megawatthours (MWh)**.
> EUE is the summation of the expected number of megawatthours of load that will not be served in a given year as a result of demand exceeding the available capacity across all hours.
> Additionally, this measure can be normalized based on the assessment area’s total Net Energy for Load.
> Normalizing the EUE provides a measure relative to the size of a given assessment area.

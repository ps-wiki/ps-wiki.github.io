### Definition in an IEC Standard

Source: <d-cite key="tc2021iec61970"></d-cite>

> IEC 61970-600-1:2021 covers the definition of Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES), defines the main rules and applicationâ€™s requirements to meet business requirements for assembled and merged model to fit relevant business services. This document does not define the business requirements, business processes nor how applications are implemented. This document defines how relevant Common Information Model (CIM) standards work together so that specific business requirements can be resolved. It also includes extensions to the Common Information Model (CIM). The current extensions are defined in IEC 61970-301:2020 and will be covered in its future Amendment 1, but additional extensions can be defined in other standards in the IEC 61970-600-series. The extensions can be used to define additional profiles or to expand IEC 61970-450-series or IEC 61968-13 profiles. However, primary CGMES includes additional constraints on existing profiles and validation of assembled and merged models that is based on existing profiles. This can be done by making optional attributes and associations mandatory (required). In addition, this document includes the specification of the serialisation that must be supported by referring to an existing standard defined in IEC 61970-550-series, e.g. IEC 61970-552, and making relevant constraints related to it. The goal is to achieve interoperability between applications using CGMES in a high-performance environment with combined minimum effort so that relevant business processes are satisfied. This first edition cancels and replaces IEC TS 61970-600-1 published in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.

**Dynamic Line Ratings (DLRs)** <d-cite key="miso2023ferc881"></d-cite> (p10) by MISO

A transmission facility rating that:
(1) applies to a time period of not greater than one hour; and
(2) reflects up-to-date forecasts of inputs such as (but not limited to) ambient air temperature, wind, solar heating intensity, transmission line tension, or transmission line sag.

**Ambient-Adjusted Ratings (AARs)** <d-cite key="miso2023ferc881"></d-cite> (p10) by MISO

A transmission facility rating that:
(1) applies to a time period of not greater than one hour;
(2) reflects an up-to-date forecast of ambient air temperature across the time period to which the rating applies;
(3) reflects the absence of solar heating during nighttime periods where the local sunrise/sunset times used to determine daytime and nighttime periods are updated at least monthly, if not more frequently; and
(4) is calculated at least each hour, if not more frequently.

**Emergency Rating** <d-cite key="miso2023ferc881"></d-cite> (p10) by MISO

A transmission facility rating that reflects operation for a specified, finite period, rather than reflecting continuous operation.
An emergency rating may assume acceptable loss of equipment life or other physical or safety limitations for the equipment involved

**Facility** <d-cite key="miso2023ferc881"></d-cite> (p10) by MISO

A set of electrical equipment ratings that collectively operates as a single bulk electric system element (e.g., transformers, relay protective devices, terminal equipment, and series and shunt compensation devices)

**Facility Rating** <d-cite key="miso2023ferc881"></d-cite> (p10) by MISO

The maximum or minimum voltage, current, frequency, or real or reactive power flow through a facility that does not violate the applicable equipment rating of any equipment comprising the facility

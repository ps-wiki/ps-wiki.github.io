> Stability is the ability of an electric power system, for a given initial operating condition, to regain a state of operating equilibrium after being subjected to a physical disturbance, with most system variables bounded so that practically the entire system remains intact.

### Definition by NERC

> The ability of an electric system to maintain a state of equilibrium during normal and abnormal conditions or disturbances.

> Stability of a power system refers to the continuance of intact operation following a disturbance. It depends on the operating condition and the nature of the physical disturbance.

> Relationships between Reliability, Security, and Stability
>
> 1. Reliability is the overall objective in power system design and operation. To be **reliable**, the power system must be **secure** most of the time. To be **secure**, the system must be **stable** but must also be secure against other contingencies that would not be classified as stability problems e.g., damage to equipment such as an explosive failure of a cable, fall of transmission towers due to ice loading or sabotage. As well, a system may be stable following a contingency, yet insecure due to post-fault system conditions resulting in equipment overloads or voltage violations.
> 2. System security may be further distinguished from stability in terms of the **resulting consequences**. For example, two systems may both be stable with equal stability margins, but one may be relatively more secure because the consequences of instability are less severe.
> 3. Security and stability are time-varying attributes which can be judged by studying the performance of the power system under a particular set of conditions. Reliability, on the other hand, is a function of the time-average performance of the power system &nbsp; it can only be judged by consideration of the system’s behavior over an appreciable period of time.

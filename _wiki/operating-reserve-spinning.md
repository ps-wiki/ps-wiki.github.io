### Definition by NERC

Source: <d-cite key="nerc2024glossary"></d-cite>

> The portion of Operating Reserve consisting of:
>
> - Generation synchronized to the system and fully available to serve load within the Disturbance Recovery Period following the contingency event; or
> - Load fully removable from the system within the Disturbance Recovery Period following the contingency event.

This definition is very similar to the [Operating Reserve – Supplemental](/wiki/operating-reserve-supplemental/), but the Supplemental Reserve includes the term "capable of being synchronized".

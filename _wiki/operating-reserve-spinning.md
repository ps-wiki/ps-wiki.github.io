**Operating Reserve – Spinning** <d-cite key="nerc2024glossary"></d-cite>

The portion of Operating Reserve consisting of:

- Generation synchronized to the system and fully available to serve load within the Disturbance Recovery Period following the contingency event; or
- Load fully removable from the system within the Disturbance Recovery Period following the contingency event.

Note: this definition is very similar to the [Operating Reserve – Supplemental](/wiki/operating-reserve-supplemental/), but the Supplemental Reserve includes the term "capable of being synchronized".

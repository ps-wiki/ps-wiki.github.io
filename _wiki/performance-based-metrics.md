> Performance-based metrics (also known as **consequence-based metrics**) are generally quantitative approaches for answering the question, “How resilient is my system?”
> These metrics interpret quantitative data that describe infrastructure performance during disruptive events.
> The required data can be collected from historical events, subject matter estimates, and computational infrastructure models.
> These metrics are suitable for benefit-cost and planning analyses because they measure the potential benefits and costs associated with proposed resilience improvements and investments.
> Resilience metrics need to include a measure of consequences and the relevant statistical probability from the probability distribution of those consequences.

> This paper describes a new approach to the synthesis of controllers for power converters based on the theory of synergetic control. The controller synthesis procedure is completely analytical, and is based on fully nonlinear models of the converter. Synergetic controllers provide asymptotic stability with respect to the required operating modes, invariance to load variations, and robustness to variation of converter parameters. With respect to their dynamic characteristics, synergetic controllers are superior to the existing types of PI controllers. We present here the theory of the approach, a synthesis example for a boost converter, simulation results, and experimental results.

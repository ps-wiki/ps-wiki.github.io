> In the event that further corrective actions are required, the outputs of effective generators are adjusted away (off-cost) from their normal assignments (on-cost). The generation control cost signal that is sent from PJM to each Generation Owner is established either automatically by computer program or manually by a PJM dispatcher (see Exhibit 4 of this manual).

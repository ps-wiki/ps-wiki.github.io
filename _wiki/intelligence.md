> Intelligence is a broad term, and the nature of human (and nonhuman) intelligence continues to be debated. Remembering information, understanding context and meaning, mentally manipulating objects, retrieving and applying knowledge learned from experience, and solving abstract problems in novel ways are all aspects of intelligence.

> We define human intelligence as a human’s “maximal capacity to achieve a novel goal successfully using perceptual-cognitive \[processes\].” 

> We define human intelligence operationally “as [a person’s] maximal capacity to complete a novel standardized task with veridical scoring using perceptual-cognitive \[processes\]."

> We propose defining artificial intelligence abstractly as the maximal capacity of an artificial system to successfully achieve a novel goal through computational algorithms.

> We propose that artificial intelligence be defined operationally as an artificial system's maximal capacity to complete a novel standardized task with veridical scoring using computational algorithms.

> Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. This includes learning, reasoning, problem-solving, perception, and language understanding. AI is significantly influencing modern technologies and research paradigms, shaping how we understand cognitive processes and enhancing various psychological disciplines.

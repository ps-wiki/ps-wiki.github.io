The Day-ahead Energy Market is a forward market in which hourly clearing prices are calculated for each hour of the next operating day based on generation offers, demand bids, increment offers, decrement bids and bilateral transaction schedules submitted into the Day-ahead Energy Market.

Forward markets for electricity to be supplied the following day.
This market closes with acceptance by the independent system operator, power exchange, or scheduling coordinator of the final day-ahead schedule.
Day-ahead is not a term commonly used for natural gas (“next day” is more common).

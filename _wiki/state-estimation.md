Source: <d-cite key="schweppe1970staticstate"></d-cite>

> The static state of an electric power system is defined as the vector of the voltage magnitudes and angles at all network buses. The static-state estimator is a data processing algorithm for converting redundant meter readings and other available information into an estimate of the static-state vector.

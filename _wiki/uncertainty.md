### Elaboration in an Article

Source: <d-cite key="hullermeier2021aleatoric"></d-cite>

> Aleatoric (aka statistical) uncertainty refers to the notion of randomness, that is, the variability in the outcome of an experiment which is due to **inherently random effects**.

> Epistemic (aka systematic) refers to uncertainty caused by a **lack of knowledge** (about the best model).
> In other words, it refers to the **ignorance** of the agent or decision maker, and hence to the epistemic state of the agent instead of any underlying random phenomenon.

> As opposed to uncertainty caused by randomness, uncertainty caused by ignorance can in principle be reduced on the basis of additional information. In other words, epistemic uncertainty refers to the **reducible** part of the (total) uncertainty, whereas aleatoric uncertainty refers to the **irreducible** part.

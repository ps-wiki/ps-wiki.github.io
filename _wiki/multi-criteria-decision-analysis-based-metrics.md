> MCDA metrics generally try to answer the question, “what is the current state of the electric system’s resilience, and what enhances its resilience over time?”
> These metrics can be used to assess the system’s baseline resilience relative to other systems.
> They typically include categories of system properties beneficial to resilience, such as robustness, resourcefulness, adaptivity, and recoverability.
> The application of these metrics requires following a process to review to what degree these properties are present within the system under analysis.
> This usually involves collecting data through surveys, developing weighting factors, and performing calculations to obtain numerical scores.
> MCDA metrics are used to calculate a resilience index (RI) that accounts for about 1,200 attributes grouped in 350 categories to characterize system resilience.

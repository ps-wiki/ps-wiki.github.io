> Loss-of-Load Hour (LOLH) is generally defined as the number of hours per year where system demand will exceed the generating capacity.
> LOLH is usually expressed in **hours per year**.
> Any outage caused by inadequate resources regardless of geographic extent or load interrupted (it could be 1 MW for a single customer or the loss of the whole area load) counts as a LOLH.
> An **LOLH of 0.1** means that **an hour of loss of load is expected for every 10 years**.
> For a particular year, the resources available and load shapes for that year are used to calculate the metrics for that year.

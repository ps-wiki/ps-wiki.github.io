### Definition in an IEEE Article by a Task Force

Source: <d-cite key="hatziargyriou2021stability"></d-cite>

We put a placeholder here because the term 'converter-driven stability' is not explicitly defined in <d-cite key="hatziargyriou2021stability"></d-cite>.
However, the dynamic behavior of converter-interfaced generation (CIG) and its impact on stability is discussed in terms of slow- and fast-interaction phenomena.

**Day-ahead Markets** <d-cite key="ferc2020glossary"></d-cite> by FERC

Forward markets for electricity to be supplied the following day.
This market closes with acceptance by the independent system operator, power exchange, or scheduling coordinator of the final day-ahead schedule.
Day-ahead is not a term commonly used for natural gas (“next day” is more common).

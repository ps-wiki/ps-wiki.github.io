### Definition by NERC

Source: <d-cite key="nerc2024glossary"></d-cite>

> Means equipment that automatically adjusts a Control Area’s generation from a central location to maintain its interchange schedule plus Frequency Bias.

### Definition by FERC

Source: <d-cite key="ferc2020glossary"></d-cite>

> The automatic regulation of the power output of electric generators within a prescribed range in response to a change in system frequency, or tie-line loading, to maintain system frequency or scheduled interchange with other areas within predetermined limits.

> Adding supplementary control on load reference set-points of selected generators:
>
> − Controlling prime-mover power to match load variations
>
> − As system load is continually changing, it is necessary to change the output of generators automatically

> Primary objective: LFC
> – Regulating frequency to the specified nominal value, e.g. 60Hz, and maintaining the interchange power between control areas at the scheduled values by adjusting the output of selected generators

> Secondary objective: Generation Dispatch
> – Distributing the required change in generation among generators to minimize operation costs.

> During large disturbances and emergencies, AGC is bypassed and other emergency controls are applied.

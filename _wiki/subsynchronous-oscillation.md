### Defintion in an Article

Source: <d-cite key="ieee1985terms"></d-cite>

> Subsynchronous oscillation is an electric power system condition where the electric network exchanges significant energy with a turbine-generator at one or more of the natural frequencies of the combined system below the synchronous frequency of the system following a disturbance from equilibrium. The above excludes the rigid body modes of the turbine-generator rotors.

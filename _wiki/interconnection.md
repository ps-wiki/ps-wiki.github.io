_Jinning's Note: this description better fits the context of "Interconnection Study"._

In the context of this manual, an interconnection refers to the connection of a new **Generating Facility**, Class Year Transmission Project, or **Load** to the NYS Transmission System;
or to materially increase the capacity of, or make a material modification to the operating characteristics of, an existing Generating Facility (including a BTM:NG Resource) or Class Year Transmission Project that is interconnected to the NYS Transmission System or Distribution System (see definition of “Interconnection Request” and related capitalized terms in Attachment X and Attachment Z to the NYISO OATT).

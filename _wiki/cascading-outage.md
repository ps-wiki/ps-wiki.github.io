**Cascading Outage** by IEEE <d-cite key="ieee2014cascading"></d-cite>

A cascading outage is a sequence of events in which an initial disturbance, or a set of disturbances, triggers a sequence of one or more dependent component outages:

- In some cases they halt before the sequence results in the interruption of electricity service
- In many case, cascading outages have resulted in massive disruptions to electricity service: Northeast blackouts in 1965 and 2003, New York City blackout in 1977, two WECC blackouts in 1996, Brazil blackout in 2009, WECC blackout in 2011, etc

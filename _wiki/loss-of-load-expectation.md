**Loss-of-Load Expectation** (LOLE) <d-cite key="nerc2013probabilistic"></d-cite>

Loss-of-Load Expectation (LOLE) is generally defined as the **number of days per year** for which the available generation capacity is insufficient to serve the demand at least once during that day.
This metric is not being reported as part of this assessment.
A criterion of one day in 10 years is an often used standard for LOLE.

**Loss-of-Load Probability** (LOLP) <d-cite key="nerc2013probabilistic"></d-cite>

Loss-of-Load Probability (LOLP) is the **probability** of system demand exceeding the generating capacity during a given period.
If LOLP is the number of days on which there is expected to be a shortfall per year, it is the same as LOLE.
However, other definitions of LOLP are also used.

**Loss-of-load events** (LOLEV) <d-cite key="nerc2013probabilistic"></d-cite>

Loss-of-Load Events (LOLEV) is the **number of events** in which some system load is not served in a given year.
A LOLEV can last for one hour or for several contiguous hours and can involve the loss of one or several hundred megawatts of load.
TRE-ERCOT is the only Assessment Area to provide this metric in its regional assessment.

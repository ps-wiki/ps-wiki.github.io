> Loss-of-Load Expectation (LOLE) is generally defined as the **number of days per year** for which the available generation capacity is insufficient to serve the demand at least once during that day.
> This metric is not being reported as part of this assessment.
> A criterion of one day in 10 years is an often used standard for LOLE.

**System Flexibility** <d-cite key="nerc2010flexible"></d-cite>

### Definition by NERC

Source: <d-cite key="nerc2010flexible"></d-cite>

> System flexibility is defined as the ability of supply-side and demand-side resources to respond to system changes and uncertainties. Flexibility also includes the ability to store energy for delivery in the future and the operational flexibility to schedule/dispatch resources in the most efficient manner.

**Flexibility Reserve** by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2024power"></d-cite> (p37)

Flexibility reserves are an emerging concept for addressing variability and uncertainty on longer timescales than operating reserves and regulation service.
The Ancillary Services Market secures **flexibility services** from suppliers to maintain balance in response to changing conditions on the electrical grid.

> An oscillation is just a repetitive motion that can be either undamped, positively damped (decaying with time), or negatively damped (growing with time).
> 
> Types of oscillations include:
> - Transients: Usually high frequency and highly damped
> - Local plant: Usually from 1 to 5 Hz
> - Inter-area oscillations: From 0.15 to 1 Hz
> - Slower dynamics: Such as AGC, less than 0.15 Hz
> - Subsynchronous resonance: 10 to 50 Hz (less than synchronous)

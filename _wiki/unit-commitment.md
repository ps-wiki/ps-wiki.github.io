> The resource commitment process includes the Markets Database (formerly the Unit Commitment Database or UCDB) and the functions of Hydro Scheduler and the Dispatch Management Tool (DMT).
> The Markets Database is a large database containing information on each resource that operates as part of the PJM Interchange Energy Market.
> The Resource Scheduling and Commitment (RSC) programs provide an optimized economic commitment schedule for thermal generating units and are the primary tool used to determine commitment of resources that have operating constraints requiring multiple-day operation.
> The Hydro Calculator computes hourly reservoir elevations and hydro plant generation from input river flows and hydro plant discharges.

### Definition in an IEEE Standard

Source: <d-cite key="ieee2024std1547"></d-cite> p10

> The sensor device to record synchro-waveforms may be referred to as waveform measurement unit (WMU). WMUs record time-synchronized waveform measurements of voltage and current at different locations of a power system. In some literature, synchro-waveforms are also referred to as time-synchronized point-on-wave (POW) measurements or time-synchronized sampled values (TSSVs). WMUs are also in some literature referred to as POW sensors or synchro-waveform measurement units (SMUs).

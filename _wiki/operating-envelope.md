### Definition in an IEEE Article

Source: <d-cite key="attarha2022networksecure"></d-cite>

An operating envelope is a convex set that defines the real and reactive power allowed to be transferred to/from the network at
a given customer connection point, or for an aggregate of customers in a region.
Envelopes are calculated so that any joint combination of consumption or generation within the envelope will not violate any
network constraints.

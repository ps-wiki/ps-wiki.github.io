Source: <d-cite key="ieee2025std2988"></d-cite> p14

> The process of the equipment to synchronize its terminal voltage with another voltage source, so that the difference between the two voltages is small, which includes some or all of the following:
>
> - frequency synchronization to have the same frequency,
> - phase synchronization to have the same phase,
> - amplitude synchronization to have the same voltage amplitude, and
> - phase sequence synchronization to have the same phase sequence.

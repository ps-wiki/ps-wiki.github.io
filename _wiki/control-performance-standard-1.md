**Control Performance Standard 1** (CPS1) <d-cite key="nerc2021balancing"></d-cite> (p29)

A **yearly** standard that measures impact on frequency error, with a 100 percent minimum allowable score.
CPS1 assigns each Control Area a share of the responsibility for control of Interconnection frequency.

_Jinning's Note: CPS1 equation can be found in <d-cite key="nerc2015bal001"></d-cite> p5._

CPS1is a:
- Statistical measure of ACE variability
- Measure of ACE in combination with the Interconnectionâ€™s frequency error
- Based on an equation derived from frequency-based statistical theory

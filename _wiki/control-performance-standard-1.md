**Control Performance Standard 1** (CPS1) <d-cite key="nerc2021balancing"></d-cite> (p29)

- CPS1 assigns each Control Area a share of the responsibility for control of Interconnection frequency.
- CPS1 is a **yearly** (i.e., rolling twelve month) standard that measures impact on frequency error, with a 100 percent minimum allowable score.

_Jinning's Note: CPS1's equation can be found in <d-cite key="nerc2015bal001"></d-cite> p5._

**CPS1** <d-cite key="nerc2015bal001background"></d-cite> (p3)

CPS1 is a:

- Statistical measure of ACE variability
- Measure of ACE in combination with the Interconnectionâ€™s frequency error
- Based on an equation derived from frequency-based statistical theory

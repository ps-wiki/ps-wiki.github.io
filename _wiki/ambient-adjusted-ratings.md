> A transmission facility rating that:
> (1) applies to a time period of not greater than one hour;
> (2) reflects an up-to-date forecast of ambient air temperature across the time period to which the rating applies;
> (3) reflects the absence of solar heating during nighttime periods where the local sunrise/sunset times used to determine daytime and nighttime periods are updated at least monthly, if not more frequently; and
> (4) is calculated at least each hour, if not more frequently.

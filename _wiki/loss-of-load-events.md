> Loss-of-Load Events (LOLEV) is the **number of events** in which some system load is not served in a given year.
> A LOLEV can last for one hour or for several contiguous hours and can involve the loss of one or several hundred megawatts of load.
> TRE-ERCOT is the only Assessment Area to provide this metric in its regional assessment.

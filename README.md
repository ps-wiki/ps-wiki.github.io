## Why This Wiki Exists

Language is inherently ambiguous, and power system terminologies are no exception. Inspired by an email titled “Definitions of Smart Grids a Decade Ago – What Has Changed?” on Power-Globe in 2024, I decided to compile terminologies from papers, standards, reports, and other traceable sources to build this wiki.

## Website Overview

Built upon the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) Jekyll theme, this website introduces significant enhancements, particularly in its new wiki section.

A custom [wiki layout](./_layouts/wiki.liquid) adapted from the `distill` layout, has been developed to effectively host item-based terminologies. Key features include:

- **Metadata Display**: Last update date, tags, and related term links
- **Navigation**: Previous/Next term links for easy Browse
- **Direct Editing**: A link to edit the term directly on GitHub
- **Community Engagement**: Integrated Giscus comments

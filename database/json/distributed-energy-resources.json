DER includes both generators and energy storage technologies capable of exporting active power to an EPS. An interconnection system or a supplemental DER device that is necessary for compliance with this standard is part of a DER. DER is equivalent to “distributed resources (DR)” as defined and used in IEEE Std 1547-2003.\n"

The composite short circuit MVA at the common bus without current contribution from the inverter-based resources, $CSC_{MVA}$, is then calculated. CSCR can then be calculated as\n>\n> $ CSCR = \\frac{CSC_{MVA}}{MW_{VER}} $\n>\n> where $MW_{VER}$ is the sum of the nominal power rating of all inverter-based resources considered. This method calculates an aggregate SCR for multiple inverter-based resources, rather than each resource like the conventional SCR approach.\n"}]}}

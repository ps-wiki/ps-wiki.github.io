The LMP calculator is interfaced to another program, the Security Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) program which models PJM generators. The LMP and SCED programs work together to develop secure, economic operating points for the electric system and to provide Automatic Generation Control (AGC).\n> These systems use data from various sources including, but not limited to, the EMS.\n> All the models are created and maintained from input data received by PJM from various sources including TOs, GOs, Load Serving Entities, and other Reliability Coordinators.\n"}]}}

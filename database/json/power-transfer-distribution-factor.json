These regions can be defined by areas, zones, super areas, single buses, injection groups or the system slack. These values provide a **linearized approximation** of how the flow on the transmission lines and interfaces change in response to a transaction between the Seller (source) and the Buyer (sink). These values can then be visualized on the onelines using animated flows.\n"}]}}

        "body_md": "> Small-signal stability, as defined in Chapter 2, is the ability of the power system to maintain synchronism when subjected to **small disturbances**. In this context, a disturbance is considered to be **small** if the equations that describe the resulting response of the system may be **linearized** for the purpose of analysis. Instability that may result can be of two forms:\n> (i) steady increase in generator rotor angle due to lack of synchronizing torque, or\n> (ii) rotor oscillations of increasing amplitude due to lack of sufficient damping torque.\n> In today’s practical power systems, the small-signal stability problem is usually one of insufficient damping of system oscillations.\n> Small-signal analysis using linear techniques provides valuable information about the inherent dynamic characteristics of the power system and assists in its design.\n\nThe term \"small-signal stability\" is sometimes used interchangeably with \"small-disturbance stability\" in the context of power system stability.\n"

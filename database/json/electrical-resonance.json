        "body_md": "> In the case of power systems with conventional turbine-generators only, the issue related to [SSR](/wiki/subsynchronous-resonance) is one of torsional interactions and resonance. The Induction Generator Effect (IGE) (or self-excitation) has never been observed in real power systems with conventional synchronous generation. However, it was predicted as early as 2003 that variable speed induction generators used in doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG) would be highly susceptible to IGE self-excitation type SSR. This is due to the fact that a variable speed DFIG generator is an induction generator directly connected to the grid, which makes such an electrical resonance between the **generator and series compensation** possible. In this case, the self-excitation type SSR occurs when the series capacitor forms a resonant circuit, at sub-synchronous frequencies, with the effective inductance of the induction generator, and at these frequencies, the net apparent resistance of the circuit is negative.\n"

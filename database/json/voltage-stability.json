The study period of interest is in the order of several seconds, similar to rotor angle stability or converter-driven stability (slow interaction type). Accordingly, models with the same degree of detail as for the above stability classes must be used. In addition, for short-term voltage stability, the dynamic modeling of loads is essential, and short circuit faults near loads are the main concern.\n\n> Long-term voltage stability involves slower acting equipment such as tap-changing transformers, thermostatically controlled loads, and generator current limiters. It usually occurs in the form of a progressive reduction of voltages at some network buses. The maximum power transfer and voltage support are further limited when some of the generators hit their field and/or armature current time-overload capability limits. The study period of interest may extend to several minutes, and long-term simulations are required for analysis of system dynamic performance.\n"},{"order":2,"id":"definition-in-a-european-union-regulation","title":"Definition in a European Union Regulation","type":"definition","source_keys":["eu2017guideline"],"page":"p6","body_md":"> 'voltage stability' means the ability of a transmission system to maintain acceptable voltages at all nodes in the transmission system in the N-situation and after being subjected to a disturbance;\n"},{"order":3,"id":"definition-in-china-grid-operation-code","title":"Definition in China grid operation code","type":"definition","source_keys":["gbt2022"],"page":"p8","body_md":"> 电压稳定：电力系统受到扰动后，系统电压能够保持或恢复到允许的范围内，不发生电压崩溃的能力。\n\nTranslation:\n\nVoltage Stability: The ability of a power system to maintain or restore system voltage within an allowable range after being subjected to a disturbance, without the occurrence of voltage collapse.\n"}]}}

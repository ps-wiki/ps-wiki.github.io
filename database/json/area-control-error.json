This means that a BA will usually have some unintentional outflow or inflow at any given instant. This mismatch in meeting a BA’s internal obligations, along with the small additional “bias” obligation to maintain frequency, is represented via a real-time value called Area Control Error (ACE), with units of MW.\n"}]}}

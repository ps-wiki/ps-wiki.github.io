The term does not include facilities used in the local distribution of electric energy.\n>\n> The Bulk Electric System (BES) is defined in [NERC’s Glossary of Terms](https://www.nerc.com/pa/Stand/Glossary%20of%20Terms/Glossary_of_Terms.pdf) as all **transmission elements** operated at 100 kV or higher and real power and reactive power resources connected at 100 kV or higher. Facilities used in the local distribution of electric energy are not included in this term.\n>\n> BES facilities that impact BPS reliability are subject to compliance with NERC’s mandatory Reliability Standards. The distribution system, which is defined the system that transports power from the transmission system to the end-use customer, is **not** overseen by NERC and is under the jurisdiction of state, provincial, or local utility regulatory agencies, except under-frequency load shedding and under-voltage load shedding relays located on the distribution system.\n"}]}}

Discrete controls, such as capacitor switch controllers, transformer tap changers, automatic switches, and relays may change their state from one step to the next. However, there is no numerical integration of differential equations between time steps. A simple quasi-static simulator can be implemented with existing power flow or short-circuit programs under supervisory control. Open-source quasi-static simulators are also available.\n"

A relevant example is the study of the eﬀect of long term voltage stability phenomena, such as the daily load ramp or voltage collapse. In this case load powers are modelled as time dependent controllable parameters $\\eta(t)$. Since load variations take from tens of minutes to some hours, any transient dynamic can be considered steady-state. The resulting system equations are obtained by imposing $\\dot{x} = 0$ in (8.12):\n>\n> $0= f(x, y, \\eta(t))$\n>\n> $0= g(x, y, \\eta(t))$\n>\n> which is generally referred to as quasi-static or quasi-steady-state model.\n"

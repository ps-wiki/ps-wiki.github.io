        "body_md": "> The term “smart grid” emerged in public technical documents at the end of 1997 and was pioneered among other individuals by Dr. M. Amin, while he was at Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), USA. This vision encompassed the integration of sensing, communication, control, automation, and cybersecurity across the entire energy system—from fuel source and generation to transmission, distribution, and end-use. The initiative developed several enabling technologies, including fast look-ahead modeling and simulation, self-healing networks, wide-area situational awareness with actionable intelligence via phasor measurement units (PMUs), fast state and topology estimation, reinforcement learning, and adaptive, automated control systems based on AI. These breakthroughs aimed to transform the grid from a reactive system into a predictive adaptive infrastructure.\n"

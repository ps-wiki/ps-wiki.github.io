Electrically close inverter-based resource buses will have a relatively higher Interaction Factor (IF) than inverter-based resource buses that are electrically separated. When multiple inverter-based resources are located very close to each other, they share the grid strength and short circuit level; hence, the grid strength is actually much lower than the overall short circuit level calculated at that bus or buses. SCRIF captures the voltage sensitivity between inverter-based resources as a screening tool for potential controls issues by using inverter-based resource interaction factors, as follows:\n>\n> $ SCRIF_{i} = \\frac{S_{i}}{P_{i} + \\sum_{j} (IF_{ji} \\cdot P_{j})} $\n>\n> Where $IF$ is the change in bus voltage at bus $i$ ($\\Delta V_{i}$) for a change in bus voltage at bus $j$ ($\\Delta V_{j}$), as follows:\n>\n> $ IF_{ij} = \\frac{\\Delta V_{i}}{\\Delta V_{j}} $\n>\n> An advantage of the use of SCRIF is that it can be readily amended to cater for any conceivable configuration for connection of multiple inverter-based resources.\n"}]}}

When something fails, the grid has to be able to isolate the problem and keep functioning.\n>\n> Grid reliability is based on two key elements:\n>\n> 1. Reliable operation – A reliable power grid has the ability to withstand sudden electric system disturbances that can lead to blackouts.\n> 2. Resource adequacy - Generally speaking, resource adequacy is the ability of the electric system to meet the energy needs of electricity consumers. This means having sufficient generation to meet projected electric demand.\n"}]}}

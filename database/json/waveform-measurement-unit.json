WMUs record time-synchronized waveform measurements of voltage and current at different locations of a power system. In some literature, synchro-waveforms are also referred to as time-synchronized point-on-wave (POW) measurements or time-synchronized sampled values (TSSVs). WMUs are also in some literature referred to as POW sensors or synchro-waveform measurement units (SMUs).\n"

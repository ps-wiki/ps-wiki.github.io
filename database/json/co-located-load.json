Co-located load is **distinct** from and does **not** include Station Power load. Examples of co-located load include a **data center**, **crypto currency mining operation**, **hydrogen hub**, etc. Although co-located load is located behind the POI, it still is electrically **connected and synchronized** to the PJM Transmission System when consuming power and therefore benefits from the use of the Transmission System and Ancillary Services.\n"

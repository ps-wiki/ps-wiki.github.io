Investment problems consider a planning horizon spanning from years to several decades, with decisions related to generating units, transmission lines and distribution systems being determined. Operation planning problems can span from days to years and encompass maintenance planning for lines, transformers and generators, fuel procurement planning and hydro-thermal scheduling. Operations problems, which often extend over minutes to days, determine scheduling and dispatch decisions. Control problems, aimed at ensuring the stability of the entire power system, cover horizons ranging from real-time to minutes.\n",

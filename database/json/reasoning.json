In deductive reasoning, the conclusion must necessarily follow from the premises, meaning that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. \n\n> Inductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on observations or evidence. The conclusion is likely to be true based on the available evidence, but it is not necessarily certain.\n\n> Abductive reasoning is a type of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn based on the best explanation for a given set of observations. The conclusion is the most likely explanation based on the available evidence, but it is not necessarily certain.\n\n> Formal reasoning is a systematic and logical process that follows a set of rules and principles, often used in mathematics and logic. Informal reasoning is a less structured approach that relies on intuition, experience, and common sense to draw conclusions and solve problems, and is often used in everyday life. Formal reasoning is more structured and reliable, while informal reasoning is more adaptable and open-ended, but may also be less reliable.\n"}]}}

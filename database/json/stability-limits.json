PJM recognizes three types of stability:\n>\n> - Steady State Stability - A gradual slow change to generation that is balanced by load.\n> - Transient Stability - The ability of a generating unit or a group of generating units to maintain synchronism following a relatively severe and sudden system disturbance. The first few cycles are the most critical time period.\n> - Dynamic Stability - The ability of a generating unit or a group of generating units to damp oscillations caused by relatively minor disturbances through the action of properly tuned control systems.\n>\n> PJM will operate the facilities that are under PJM operational control such that the PJM system will maintain angular and voltage stability following any single facility malfunction or failure.\n>\n> In general, stability is not a limiting constraint on the PJM RTO.\n"},{"order":2,"id":"another-definition-by-pjm","title":"Another Definition by PJM","type":"definition","source_keys":["pjm2024m11"],"page":"p82, Revision 133","body_md":"> The ability of a generating unit or a group of generating units to maintain synchronism following a system disturbance can be identified using real time and study applications such as the PJM Transient Stability Analysis (TSA) tool.

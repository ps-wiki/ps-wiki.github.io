**synchronous machine** (SM) <d-cite key="ieee2025std2988"></d-cite> (p15)

A synchronous machine is an ac electrical machine operated with a constant electromagnetic field. Its instantaneous speed of normal operation is exactly proportional to the frequency of
its ac voltage.
An SM with a round rotor has a uniform air gap, so that the reluctance does not depend on the flux position. Contrarily, the air gap of an SM with a salient-pole rotor varies circumferentially around the rotor, resulting in a non-uniform reluctance.

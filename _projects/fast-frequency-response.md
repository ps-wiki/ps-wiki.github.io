**Fast Frequency Response** <d-cite key="nerc2020ffr"></d-cite> (p23) by ERCOT

Power injected to (or absorbed from) the grid in response to changes in measured or observed frequency during the **arresting phase** of a frequency excursion event to improve the **frequency nadir** or **initial rate-of-change of frequency**

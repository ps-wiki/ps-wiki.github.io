title: The February 2021 Cold Weather Outages in Texas and the South Central United States
description: The Texas Winter Storm of 2021, also known as Winter Storm Uri, caused widespread power outages, water shortages, and significant economic damage across Texas due to extreme cold weather and inadequate winterization of the state's energy infrastructure.

Today’s final report provides more details <d-cite key="ferc2021texas"></d-cite>:
- 81 percent of freeze-related generating unit outages occurred at temperatures above the units’ stated ambient design temperature.
- 87 percent of unplanned generation outages due to fuel issues were related to natural gas, predominantly related to production and processing issues, while 13 percent involved issues with other fuels such as coal or fuel oil.
- Natural gas fuel supply issues were caused by natural gas production declines, with 43.3 percent of natural gas production declines caused by freezing temperatures and weather, and 21.5 percent caused by midstream, wellhead or gathering facility power losses, which could be attributed either to rolling blackouts or weather-related outages such as downed power lines.

The Final Report includes 28 formal recommendations that seek to prevent a recurrence of the failures experienced during the February 2021 cold weather event.
These recommendations include important revisions to the NERC Reliability Standards surrounding generator winterization and gas-electric coordination. 

Additional recommendations are included regarding topics such as cold weather impacts on mechanical and electrical components, utilization of weather forecasts to better predict electric demand, and increasing the ability to rotate rolling blackouts, amongst other recommendations.
The report also encourages additional study of the ERCOT system’s reliability issues, guidance on identification of natural gas infrastructure for protection from rolling blackouts, and additional ways to address natural gas fuel supply shortfalls during extreme cold weather events.

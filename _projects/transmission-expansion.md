**Transmission Expansion** by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p4, Version 4.2)

A transmission expansion is the **addition or modification** of facilities of the NYS Transmission System that may be proposed or initiated by an Eligible Customer, including a TO, under Section 3.7 of or Attachment P to the NYISO OATT.

**Transmission Interconnection Procedures** (TIP) by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p4, Version 4.2)

TIP evaluates the need for and identifies any Network Upgrade Facilities that would be required to
accommodate the proposed transmission project.

The costs involved in the NYISO TIP process include <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p6, Version 4.2):

- $10,000 nonrefundable application fee;
- Various deposits that are applied toward study costs (see Figure 1 below);
- Actual study costs incurred by the NYISO, the Connecting Transmission Owner(s); and Affected System Operator(s).
- Cost (or cost allocation) of any Network Upgrade Facilities identified in the TIP studies.

The basic steps of the TIP are <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p7, Version 4.2):

- Initial Processing of the TIA;
- Scoping Meeting;
- Optional Feasibility Study;
- System Impact Study;
- Facilities Study;
- Engineering & Procurement Agreement (optional)
- Transmission Project Interconnection Agreement; and
- Construction, installation, registration and operation.

**Optional Feasibility Study** (OFES) by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p9 Version 4.2)

OFES is an option of the Transmission Developer, its purpose is to provide information to the Transmission Developer regarding the feasibility of the proposed interconnection in advance of embarking on a SIS.

**System Impact Study** (SIS) by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p16, Version 4.2)

The purpose of the SIS is to evaluate the impact of the proposed transmission project on the reliability of the NYS Transmission System and if study results indicate that the project, as proposed, would result in any adverse impact on reliability or violations of reliability standards and identify any Network Upgrades that would be required to mitigate any such adverse impact(s) or violation(s).

**Facilities Study** by NYISO <d-cite key="nyiso2023tei"></d-cite> (p21, Version 4.2)

The main purpose and objective of the Facilities Study is to provide to the Customer good faith estimates of the cost and time to construct the new facilities identified in the SIS.

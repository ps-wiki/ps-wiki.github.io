**Bilateral Transaction** <d-cite key="ferc2020glossary"></d-cite> by FERC

A direct contract between a seller and buyer outside of a centralized market or exchange (e.g. Nymex or an RTO/ISO).
In energy markets, the buyer or seller usually finds his or her matching counter-party through a broker (e.g. voice brokers, ICE, etc.).

**Primary Frequency Response** <d-cite key="nerc2024glossary"></d-cite>

The immediate proportional increase or decrease in real power output provided by generating units/generating facilities and the natural real power dampening response provided by Load in response to system Frequency Deviations.
This response is in the direction that stabilizes frequency.

**Loss-of-Load Hour** (LOLH) <d-cite key="nerc2013probabilistic"></d-cite>

Loss-of-Load Hour (LOLH) is generally defined as the number of hours per year where system demand will exceed the generating capacity.
LOLH is usually expressed in **hours per year**.
Any outage caused by inadequate resources regardless of geographic extent or load interrupted (it could be 1 MW for a single customer or the loss of the whole area load) counts as a LOLH.
An **LOLH of 0.1** means that **an hour of loss of load is expected for every 10 years**.
For a particular year, the resources available and load shapes for that year are used to calculate the metrics for that year.

**Small-Signal Stability** <d-cite key="kundur1994Power"></d-cite> (p699, first edition)

Small-signal stability, as defined in Chapter 2, is the ability of the power system to maintain synchronism when subjected to **small disturbances**.
In this context, a disturbance is considered to be **small** if the equations that describe the resulting response of the system may be **linearized** for the purpose of analysis.
Instability that may result can be of two forms:
(i) steady increase in generator rotor angle due to lack of synchronizing torque, or
(ii) rotor oscillations of increasing amplitude due to lack of sufficient damping torque.
In todayâ€™s practical power systems, the small-signal stability problem is usually one of insufficient damping of system oscillations.
Small-signal analysis using linear techniques provides valuable information about the inherent dynamic characteristics of the power system and assists in its design.

_Jinning's Note: The term "small-signal stability" is sometimes used interchangeably with "small-disturbance stability" in the context of power system stability._

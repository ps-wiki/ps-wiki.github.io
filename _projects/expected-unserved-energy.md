**Expected Unserved Energy** (EUE) <d-cite key="nerc2013probabilistic"></d-cite>

Expected Unserved Energy (EUE) is a measure of the generation and transmission system’s capability to continuously serve all loads at all delivery points while satisfying all planning criteria.
EUE is energy-centric and analyzes all hours of a particular year.
Results are calculated in **megawatthours (MWh)**.
EUE is the summation of the expected number of megawatthours of load that will not be served in a given year as a result of demand exceeding the available capacity across all hours.
Additionally, this measure can be normalized based on the assessment area’s total Net Energy for Load.
Normalizing the EUE provides a measure relative to the size of a given assessment area.

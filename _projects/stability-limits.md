**Stability Limits** by PJM <d-cite key="pjm2024m3"></d-cite> (p40, Revision 67)

Limits based on **voltage phase angle difference** to protect portions of the PJM RTO from separation or unstable operation.

**Stability Limits** by PJM <d-cite key="pjm2024m11"></d-cite> (p82, Revision 133)

The ability of a generating unit or a group of generating units to maintain synchronism following a system disturbance can be identified using real time and study applications such as the PJM Transient Stability Analysis (TSA) tool.
Based on results from TSA, stability limits will be established and logged within PJMâ€™s TO Connection.
For real power (MW) stability limits only, TO Connection **stability limits will be translated into a corresponding generator output constraint** (in MW) for a single generator or a group of generators.
